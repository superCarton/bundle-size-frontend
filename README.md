# BundleSizeFrontend

Computes the size of NPM modules when they will be injected in a bundle, minified and gzipped. Display nicely in a chart the size difference with its previous versions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run the following commands in a terminal to run locally the app.

```
yarn
yarn start
```

## Backend server

Clone and run the backend from [this github repository](https://github.com/superCarton/bundle-size-backend.git)

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Improvements TODO

- Swagger specifications of the API to define the contract between backend and frontend. This would allow interfaces code and API fetch methods generation.
